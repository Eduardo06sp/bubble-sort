# bubble-sort

In this project, I built a bubble_sort method that sorts the array it takes in. Then I created a slightly more complex method named bubble_sort_by. This method sorts an array by accepting a block, functioning similarly to using the spaceship operator.

Some of the skills I utilized for this project were:

* Learning about the bubble sort method, a very simple sorting algorithm

* Integrating the aforementioned sorting algorithm into my code to sort an array

* Learning about blocks in Ruby and use a yield statement to call block in method

* Pass arguments to block in yield statement to determine how array will be sorted in bubble_sort_by method
